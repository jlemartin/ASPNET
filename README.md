This full stack development project allowed for the inventory of products from a retailer of electronics goods to be presented in a web browser from the MySQL database where they had been stored - along with the functionality of updating, deleting, and adding items. The functionality of viewing the product categories and seeing the products by category was added beyond the assigned scope of the project.
